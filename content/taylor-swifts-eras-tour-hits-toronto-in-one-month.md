Taylor Swift is expected to inject hundreds of millions of dollars into Toronto’s economy when her record-busting The Eras Tour comes to Toronto next month, according to a new report released Tuesday.

According to Destination Toronto, a marketing organization for the city’s tourism industry, the U.S. superstar’s two-week visit is expected to have an economic impact of more than $282 million, which includes more than $152 million in direct spending. 

“This tour has just captured global attention and imagination in a way that few before it have,” said Andrew Weir, CEO and president of Destination Toronto. “The real power of tourism is it brings new money into our economy. It’s not just moving around the same money over and over again.”
