Premier Doug Ford is set to provide an update on the province’s COVID-19 vaccination plan Friday afternoon.

The announcement comes after Health Minister Christine Elliott said yesterday that Ontario is “recalibrating” its timeline for giving out vaccines after the approval of AstraZeneca’s vaccine and new guidelines for administering second doses.

“We were looking at the end of the summer, probably into perhaps September,” Elliott said to the media Thursday afternoon. “I think it's fair to say that we will be able to shorten that timeline, given the new volumes of vaccines coming in with AstraZeneca, and the extension of the first and second doses for both Pfizer and Moderna, meaning we can get more first dose into more arms faster.”
