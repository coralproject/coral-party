From fresh tofu spring rolls to a one-pot pasta dish, the five recipes featured here are meal suggestions the whole family is sure to love. Check out what you’re having for dinner this week!

Monday: Tofu and Peanut Spring Rolls

Spring rolls are a popular meal choice for summer, as they often require little to no cooking and just taste fresh. There’s tofu to fill you up, and the likes of mango, cucumber, Boston lettuce leaves and herbs, too. Don’t forget the savoury peanut butter sauce to tie the whole meal together.

Tuesday: One-Pot Cheese Tortellini

One-Pot Cheese Tortellini.

The best recipes are often times the easiest, particularly when you need only a single pot to prepare everything. Simply cook the tortellini in chicken broth, then add leek, pancetta, peas and cream, and you’ve got a meal the whole family will love.

Wednesday: Pork Steaks with Lemon-Rosemary Fries

Pork Steaks with Lemon-Rosemary Fries

The taste of your favourite restaurant but right at home? Yes. Try pork steaks for dinner with flavourful steakhouse-inspired fries which pair beautifully with the pan sauce made from the pork’s cooking juices.

Thursday: Cream of Corn with Barbecue Tofu

Cream of Corn with Barbecue Tofu

Sure, this recipe calls for frozen corn. But it’s the season for fresh corn, so make the most of it by whipping up this soup with its rich texture and barbecue-sauce-laden tofu added on top. Surprising and delicious.

Friday: Salmon Rolls

Salmon Rolls

While we were all about lobster rolls at the beginning of summer when the seafood was at its peak, we still want a taste of vacation while the warm season continues for a little longer. Opt for tasty salmon, tossed with mayo, green onion and celery, then served in a hot dog bun topped with peppery arugula.
