The Toronto Star has won court-approved access to police investigative documents in the now four-year-old unsolved Barry and Honey Sherman murder case, and the documents are being released in chronologic order, not all at once. Last week, we reported that in 2019, homicide detectives had compiled a list of cellular telephone numbers of “persons of interest” in the case, and were seeking court permission to get a tower “dump” of all cellular communication around Barry and Honey the night they died, hoping to find a match with a stalker. In today’s instalment, the Star reveals what police learned in 2020, and where the investigation was headed.

By September 2020, Toronto police probing the murders of the two billionaires were using terms like “walking man” and “killer” in their investigative notes, describing a belief that an unknown “male” with an unusual gait was their prime suspect.

As detailed in the search warrant and production order requests police made to obtain cellular telephone tracking data, detectives now had a “working theory.”

“The theory being that investigators believe that both Bernard and Honey Sherman were murdered and that the perpetrator, believed to be a male, hereinafter referred to as the ‘walking man’ that is seen on video surveillance” was their prime suspect, a detective wrote in a request to the court for permission to conduct additional analysis of cellular communication data.

“Any emerging patterns could reveal that the Shermans were under surveillance prior to their murders or could reveal the identity of the “walking man,” police wrote.

Barry Sherman, founder of Apotex pharmaceutical company, and his wife Honey were murdered in their Toronto home between 9 p.m. and midnight on Wednesday, Dec. 13, 2017. Their bodies were discovered by a realtor showing the house 36 hours later. Once police moved from a murder-suicide theory to double murder (six weeks into the case), investigators focused on a series of video images collected from neighbourhood cameras that revealed a man walking up to the Sherman property, spending a “suspicious” amount of time there, and then leaving the same way he had come. Investigative files released by a court reveal police believe this is the Sherman’s “killer.”

On Tuesday, December 14, 2021, investigators released a video of a person identified as a suspect in the Sherman murder case.

The walking man’s identity remains a mystery to this day.

At a police press conference in December, Det. Sgt. Brandon Price told the media that using a technique known as “photogrammetry” they had determined the person was between five-foot-six-and-three-quarters and five-foot-nine-and-a-half. What Price did not tell the media is that, according to the police documents, it took detectives almost two years to estimate the individual’s height, an analysis that took only two weeks to complete. Photo gammetry uses known objects in an area (a tree, fire hydrant, etc.) and other factors to estimate height and weight of an individual caught on video or in a photo.

As the newly released documents describe, police theorized that the walking man was in cellular communication with people who were “persons of interest” in the case. Or, that the walking man was in cellular communication with an intermediary in the area who in turn was in contact with a person of interest. The documents do not raise the possibility that the individual was communicating by two-way mobile radio, which would not be captured by a cell tower.

To understand how the Toronto police have been investigating this case, put aside images from detective shows like Baltimore-based police drama Homicide Life on the Street, or British police procedural show Scott & Bailey, with scenes of detectives pounding the pavement and knocking on doors. The lone full-time detective on the Sherman case, Det. Constable Dennis Yim was charged with investigating by cellular communication.

First, they collected roughly 300 cellular telephone numbers from the Sherman family, friends, business associates, and people who worked for the Shermans. Those numbers and the associated names went into a spreadsheet. According to the documents, these were numbers that came from several sources. First, interviews police conducted — detectives asked people for their cellular phone number or numbers of people that the interviewee speculated could have committed the murders. Documents released reveal that the Sherman family and some friends were pointing fingers at three individuals not named in the documents (police say they have found no evidence these individuals were involved.) Police also received 18 cellphone numbers from tips the public made directly to Toronto Police; 41 numbers from tips made to a dedicated Sherman murder tip line police set up a year into the case; and 184 numbers passed on by the Sherman family’s private investigation team led by criminal lawyer Brian Greenspan.

Then, in early 2019, police went before Judge Leslie Pringle of the Ontario Court of Justice, asking for permission to obtain “tower dumps” from Bell, Telus, Rogers and Freedom Mobile for areas around the Sherman home and Apotex on the night of the murders, and also weeks and in some cases months previous to the murders. The mechanics of this are relatively simple: When a cellular telephone is used to make a call or receive a text, it communicates with a cellular tower in the area, creating a “handshake.” This data is specific to an area — think of drawing an invisible electronic box around a property or section of the street.

As the newly released documents from September 2020 show, the police order was granted, under the proviso that police use a strict protocol to maintain the privacy of innocent people whose cellular communication patterns were picked up in the massive tower dump sweep.

The next step was to run a comparison to those roughly 300 “person of interest” numbers and the tower dump. This was at least a partial success. Sometime in 2020, police started getting “hits” — person of interest numbers showed up in the tower dumps.

That set police to conducting “background investigations ... for the phone numbers, from phone records obtained by way of production order, that were common to the tower dump transmission data results.”

It’s likely that most, if not all of these numbers found in the “tower dumps” are people innocent of the crime, but who just happened to be in the area at the time. What the documents do not reveal (due to redactions) is whether police identified “pings” to cell towers approximating the movements of the “walking man” and whether those pings correspond to the lengthy list of “persons of interest.”

The term “persons of interest” is a term police use to describe, quite literally, someone “of interest” in a case, but not someone who is a suspect. Police require evidence of suspicion of a crime to raise the status to “suspect,” which they have recently done with the unknown “walking man.”

The police documents are heavily redacted in the portions that describe these hits — all person of interest numbers that show up in the tower dumps are blacked out.

Of additional interest in the newly-released documents is the fact that something police discovered in the tower dumps caused them to run a comparison with information police received in an international production order they obtained in 2020. Canadian police, through the federal government, can gather information overseas with 35 countries covered by what is known as a “mutual legal assistance treaty.”

The final page of police documents released to the Star as of Monday has a completely blacked-out section headed, “Relevant results from mutual legal assistance treaties.”

With each new batch of documents released, more information comes out about the case, including the crime scene.

In these newly released documents, designated by police as ITOs #11 and #12 (an ITO is an “information to obtain” a search warrant or a production order), we get a clearer picture of the crime scene than in previous documents released. For the first time, the belts looped around the Sherman’s necks are identified as “black belts.”

“Their arms were behind them and their bodies were being held up by black belts wrapped around their necks and tied to a railing approximately” three feet (just under a metre) above the deck of the pool. The documents show the Shermans were positioned with their backs to the pool, feet almost touching the wall on one side of the pool. Barry’s wrists were “restrained” at some point, but no ties or other restraints were found at the crime scene.

The documents also reveal for the first time a reference to “bloodstains on the victims,” an observation from a forensics detective that is not further explained. The Star, from its own investigation, has learned that the blood at the scene was relatively minor, most likely coming from Honey’s nose as a result of the “ligature compression” on her neck that killed her. Honey had a small mark on her right eye. Barry had no markings on his face and his eyeglasses were neatly perched on his nose. Both Shermans were wearing their shoes.

And police have also revealed that Honey’s last known email was sent sometime on the Wednesday evening the Shermans died, an innocuous request to mydrap.com, a cotton napkin supplier, asking if they ship product to both Canada and the U.S. Honey was known for enjoying functions with family and friends during the holiday season.
