Gordon, 30, first entered the league as a second-round pick made by the Cleveland Browns in the 2012 Supplemental Draft. The 6-foot-3, 225-pound receiver’s first NFL suspension for a violation of the NFL’s substance-abuse policy came in 2013 — when he was out two games but still went on to the best year of his career: 87 catches for 1,646 yards and nine touchdowns.

Gordon went on to be suspended by the league another five times for varying reasons, missing the 2015 and 2016 seasons altogether. The Browns traded Gordon to the New England Patriots in 2018. He played 11 games with the club that season before stepping away in mid-December. Shortly after Gordon’s made that announcement, the NFL suspended him indefinitely for violating the terms of his reinstatement.

New England went on to defeat the Los Angeles Rams in the Super Bowl that season — and then waived Gordon from injured reserve, where had been placed due to a knee injury (we have a timeline on Gordon up to this point from SB Nation). He was claimed by the Seattle Seahawks, with whom he would spend five games before a sixth suspension. His last game was on December 15, 2019.

The NFL recently reinstated Gordon, telling him he may be able to be back on the field as early as Week 4. That would be the Chiefs’ visit to Philadelphia to play the Eagles, though it’s likely to be a little longer wait than that.
