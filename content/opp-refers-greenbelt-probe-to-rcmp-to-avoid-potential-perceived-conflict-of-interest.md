The Ontario Provincial Police, which has been reviewing whether to launch a criminal investigation into Premier Doug Ford’s Greenbelt land swap, is referring the matter to the Mounties.

In a statement Wednesday — one day after a top Progressive Conservative aide resigned over the affair — the OPP said it “has received a number of inquiries regarding an investigation into the Greenbelt.”

“To avoid any potential perceived conflict of interest, the OPP referred this matter to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police,” the provincial force said.

“In order to protect the integrity of the process, it would not be appropriate to provide any further comment. Questions should be directed to the RCMP.”

The move came the morning after Ford’s government parted ways with Ryan Amato, who was blamed in the $8.28-billion Greenbelt land swap controversy.

“The premier’s office has accepted Ryan Amato’s resignation as chief of staff to the minister of municipal affairs and housing, effective immediately,” Ivana Yelich, Ford’s deputy chief of staff, said Tuesday afternoon.

Amato’s departure came a fortnight after a report from auditor general Bonnie Lysyk found the aide ignored the usual guardrails provided by bureaucrats and planners, and personally selected 14 of the 15 parcels of protected land to be removed from the Greenbelt.

That ended up in “prominent developers” getting 7,400 acres of environmentally sensitive land in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area opened up to build 50,000 homes.

Lysyk said that could mean an $8.28-billion bonanza for the landowners.

Integrity commissioner J. David Wake, who is also doing a probe of the Greenbelt land swap, is investigating whether Amato breached the Public Service Act.

Amato, who has retained counsel, has not been available for comment.

It is not unusual for the OPP, which is funded by Queen’s Park, to refer potentially politically sensitive cases to other forces.

Speaking to reporters at a federal cabinet retreat in Charlottetown, where Canada’s housing shortage tops the agenda, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was careful when asked about Ford’s controversy.

“First of all, I’m not going to comment on decisions that that police agencies make in terms of their investigations. I will refer to the RCMP for any comments or questions you want about about this issue,” said Trudeau.

“Secondly, we’ve been very clear that yes, we need to ensure more housing is built across this country, more affordable housing ... more purpose-built rental stock ... that there are more options for young people who are working hard to join the middle class,” the prime minister said.

“We see densification — we see proper partnerships with municipalities across provinces as being essential to do that,” he said.

“But we don’t think the only solution is to build on protected land.”
