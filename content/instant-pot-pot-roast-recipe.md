## Ingredients

- 3 lb. chuck roast
- Kosher salt
- Freshly ground black pepper
- 1 tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 onion, chopped
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tsp. chopped rosemary
- 1 tsp. chopped thyme
- 3 tbsp. tomato paste
- 2 tbsp. all-purpose flour
- 1/2 c. red wine
- 3 c. low-sodium beef broth
- 1 tbsp. Worcestershire sauce
- 1 lb. baby potatoes, halved
- 4 medium carrots, peeled and sliced on the bias

## Directions

1. Season chuck roast generously with salt and pepper. Turn Instant Pot to Sauté setting, set for 15 minutes, and heat oil. When oil is shimmering, add beef and cook until seared on both sides, about 5 minutes per side. Remove beef then add onion. Cook, stirring occasionally, until starting to soften, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic, herbs, and tomato paste and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in flour, then whisk in wine until combined. Bring to boil and cook until slightly thickened, about 2 minutes.
2. Add broth, Worcestershire sauce, potatoes, and carrots and 1 tablespoon salt and a bunch of freshly ground black pepper. Place beef on top of mixture. Lock lid and set to pressure cook on high for 1 hour.
3. Follow manufacturer’s guide for quick release, making sure to wait until cycle is complete before unlocking and removing lid. Let beef rest in sauce for at 10 minutes.
4. Slice roast against grain.
