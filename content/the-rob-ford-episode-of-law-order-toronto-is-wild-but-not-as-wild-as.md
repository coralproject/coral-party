The nod in this week's "Law & Order Toronto" to the scandal that consumed former mayor Rob Ford is a quick and wild ride — but maybe not as implausible as the real-life political drama that gripped this city. 

Officially, the producers note at the start of the episode airing Thursday night that the events are fictional and do not depict any actual person or event. OK, but how many mayors of Toronto have been caught on video smoking crack cocaine? The late Rob Ford, chief magistrate from 2010 to 2014, that's who.

The fictional, tripping mayor — who does not look or sound like Ford — is caught on video snarling: "Hey man, nobody's going to tell me what to do, I'm the goddamned mayor." Ford didn't say that in the infamous 2013 crack tape, but it sums up the populist politician's world view for much of his chaotic, scandal-filled term. The mayor in "Law & Order" later says: "My base is strong," so diehard supporters will forgive his failings, which he rationalizes by asking: "Do you have any idea how difficult a mayoral campaign can be?"

While under the influence, he gives a kick in the air reminiscent of Ford moves in a subsequent video in which he wrestled, literally, with substance abuse. 

There are other nods to reality in the dimly lit noir look at city hall. The reporter who gets the leaked video is young and female like my former colleague Robyn Doolittle, who broke the story with reporter Kevin Donovan.

Council scenes are shot in the city hall chamber and councillors' offices look like the real thing, down to campaign signs leaning in the corner.

There is talk of politicians helping "greedy" developers and also the police budget, a hot topic at city hall last month.


The story, however, veers wildly from reality. The investigative reporter is murdered, as is another central character. It's "Law & Order," not "Politics & Order," so the mayor's crack smoking — and its impact on a re-election campaign that in real life didn't include Rob Ford after his cancer diagnosis — are subplots. The detectives are busy, between cynical quips about city hall, trying to catch a killer, not restore order to the government of Canada's biggest city.

While the Rob Ford saga played out over years, the scandal is done in days on "Law & Order." Wrapping it up, a detective tells the killer: "I think you mistook politics for war, but this isn't war — it's a circus and two innocent people are dead." 

While that may seem far-fetched — what gets wrapped up at city hall in a few days? — consider the reality: City councillor with a history of outrageous statements and alcohol abuse gets elected mayor. Early political wins confound expectations. Outrageous statements and public alcohol abuse re-emerge.

The crack tape surfaces, is vehemently denied and eventually acknowledged. The mayor goes to rehab and emerges refreshed and heading for possible re-election. Cancer strikes and, after a return to city council and apparently successful surgery, he dies. Multiple subplots include high school football helping get the mayor ejected from office and then saved in court on a technicality.

Which producer would green light that crazy script? Who would believe that tragedy?

"Law & Order" also takes liberties with journalism. Political scrums don't all happen in front of the TORONTO sign in Nathan Phillips Square. The reporter who got the crack tape says the scoop will be "drinks at the Four Seasons big." Find me a reporter in that swanky hotel's bar. They are more likely to be eating in their car. She also has an affair with her boss, which is unnecessary and not indicative of modern newsrooms, but less odious than the corrosive trope ("House of Cards," etc.) of having female reporters sleep with political sources. 

"Law & Order" gets one thing correct, though. A detective, asked if she thinks the editor hired somebody to kill his reporter girlfriend, calls BS on that possibility. "My mother's a journalist, works her ass off, barely makes a living wage."
