Nobody said clinching a spot in the playoffs was going to be easy. Well, at least no one who spent the bulk of their summer watching the Blue Jays.

Toronto’s performance has been difficult to predict all year. One week they’re up, the next they’re down and while some turbulence should be expected across a 162-game schedule, these Jays always take it to the extreme.

So, perhaps it shouldn’t be surprising that when the Jays returned home earlier this week needing — at most — three wins to clinch a spot in the post-season, they came away from the first two games with nothing to show for it. What once seemed like a simple task has since become a bit more challenging.

So, perhaps it shouldn’t be surprising that when the Jays returned home earlier this week needing — at most — three wins to clinch a spot in the post-season, they came away from the first two games with nothing to show for it. What once seemed like a simple task has since become a bit more challenging.

On Tuesday, the Jays were shut out by Michael King and the Yankees bullpen. The following day it was more of the same as they were shutout again by Cy Young candidate Gerrit Cole in a 6-0 loss at Rogers Centre. Eighteen innings, five hits, zero runs.

“Whenever you’re playing at this time of year, or into the post-season, you’re facing really good pitching,” Jays manager John Schneider said. “There are ways to take advantage of that, whether it be get on base and use the running game like we did in Tampa, string some hits together, or try to do some damage. There were some good at-bats … a couple balls that were just missed, couple deep counts and just didn’t hit the pitch that we should.”

Despite this week’s results, the Jays still aren’t in serious jeopardy of missing the post-season, at least not yet. A 3-1 record over the final four games against the Yankees and Rays would secure a spot no matter what happens elsewhere. Even 2-2 would require a lot to go wrong for them not to advance.

But that’s the same situation the Jays found themselves in at the start of the week. Two wins were expected to be all they needed but there were six games remaining then — now there’s four. So, unless the Jays want to pin all their playoff hopes on getting help from the out-of-town scoreboard, they better start winning again — and soon.

That’s hard to do that against pitchers as good as King and Cole. In the series opener, the only hit the Jays got off King was a third-inning single by Alejandro Kirk. The only two vs. Cole came courtesy of Brandon Belt, who doubled in the second and singled in the seventh. Cole’s season now ends with him as the presumptive favourite for the American League Cy Young Award with a 15-4 record and 2.63 ERA.

Cole’s season now ends with him as the presumptive favourite for the American League Cy Young Award with a 15-4 record and 2.63 ERA.

“You have to really take advantage of mistakes, is the biggest thing,” Schneider said when asked about the challenges of facing a guy like Cole. “There are nights when you do it, there are nights when you don’t. The last two nights were the latter.”

There’s more elite pitching where that came from arriving soon. The Twins might not have this year’s Cy Young winner, but they have Sonny Gray and Pablo Lopez, who have been in the mix for most of the year. The Rays, another potential first-round opponent, have Zach Eflin and Tyler Glasnow with a versatile bullpen to back them up.

The other playoff contenders — outside of Baltimore — have plenty of front-line arms too. The Jays are no exception, but to leverage their AL-leading 3.74 ERA they must score at least four runs on most nights. So far this week, they haven’t scored any.

Right-hander José Berríos got saddled with the loss on Wednesday despite retiring the first nine batters. His outing changed in the fourth when a leadoff walk to D.J. LeMahieu was followed by a two-run shot off the bat of Aaron Judge.

By then, two runs seemed unsurmountable based on the way Cole was pitching, but if there was any lingering doubt, the Yankees put an end to it in the fifth. They loaded the bases before Giancarlo Stanton hit a two-run single to left. A couple innings later, Judge made things even worse with his second two-run homer of the night.

That left the Jays stuck on 87 wins, which was one more than the Astros and two more than the Mariners entering Wednesday night’s slate of west-coast games. It was also one fewer than the Texas Rangers, who travel to Seattle on Thursday to open a four-game series against the Mariners.

The fact that one of Texas or Seattle will lose every day for the remainder of the week is helpful to the Jays. So too is the tiebreaker they own over the Astros because of a superior head-to-head record. Still, this is a Jays team that would prefer to earn its way in, not qualify because of someone else’s faults.

To do that, the Jays must play better than they did in the first two games vs. New York and based on how this season has gone they probably will. This group has struggled when the bandwagon’s full and then seems to thrive when people start jumping off.

“We still want it, we still have in mind that we want to make that happen,” Berríos said when asked about clinching a spot. “Obviously we want to win but we have four more games. Tonight’s already (done). We’ll go home, get rest, and come tomorrow looking to win.”

A chart of the Jays’ post-season probabilities throughout the year would be enough to make even the world’s biggest fan of roller-coasters a bit nauseous. In late April, they were given an 87.8 per cent chance of qualifying and by the end of the next month it was down to 45.1. This month, it has been as high as 97.7 and as low as 33.6.

Those odds do little except illustrate how unpredictable this Jays team is. They might make a deep run through the post-season, get eliminated in the first round, or who knows, maybe they’ll flame out before even getting there.

It’s impossible to say right now, but one thing everyone knows for sure, this team isn’t going anywhere until it starts scoring runs.
