Ingredients
1 package (8 g) active dry yeast (or 25 g fresh yeast)
2eggs
875ml3 1/2 cups flour, sifted
23ml1 1/2 tbsp salt
50ml1/4 cup olive oil
125ml1/2 cup truffle paste
150g5 oz fontina cheese, shredded
40g1 small truffle, about 1 1/2 oz
1small bunch frisée, separated
Truffle oil (optional)
Directions
1
Proof the yeast according to the manufacturer's instructions. Place the eggs in their shells in a bowl of warm water for 5 minutes. Transfer activated yeast to the bowl of a stand mixer with 2 1/2 cups of the flour, the eggs, salt, 2 tbsp of the olive oil, and 3/4 cups warm water. Blend with a dough hook on low speed.
2
Once it is well-mixed and has balled together, feel the dough. If it is sticky, add more flour and work it again. You want the dough to be tacky to the touch but not sticky. Let the dough rest in a covered bowl on the countertop for 2 hours.
3
Preheat grill to high and oven to 450°F (230°C).
4
Mix truffle paste with the remaining olive oil. Roll out dough on a floured surface, stretching it out into oblongs of desired size.
5
For each pizza, oil the grill rack, and place the dough directly on top of the freshly lubricated surface. As soon as the first side crisps, flip it over and cook the second. Then remove the pizza crust to a work surface and smear or brush it with the diluted truffle paste.
6
Sprinkle it generously with shredded cheese and transfer to the oven just long enough for the cheese to melt, 1 to 2 minutes. While the cheese is still piping hot, shave the truffle over the pizza to taste. Follow with a sprinkling of frisée sprigs and, if desired, a scattering of truffle oil. Enjoy at once.
