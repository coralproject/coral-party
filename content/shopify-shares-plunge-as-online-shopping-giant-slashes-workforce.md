That big pandemic bump for online shopping? Seems it wasn’t permanent after all.

Ottawa-based online shopping giant Shopify announced Tuesday it is laying off 10 per cent of its workforce, with CEO Tobias Lutke admitting the company had bet too heavily on the COVID bump.

“We bet that the channel mix — the share of dollars that travel through e-commerce rather than physical retail — would permanently leap ahead by five or even 10 years,” Lutke said in a memo on the company’s website.

“It’s now clear that bet didn’t pay off. What we see now is the mix reverting to roughly where pre-COVID data would have suggested it should be at this point.”

In TSX trading after the layoffs were announced, Shopify shares plunged by more than 14 per cent. By 11:15 a.m., they’d fallen to $40.19, a drop of $6.92 on the day.

It’s been a catastrophic year for Shopify stocks, which began 2022 trading at $155.22.

The move will eliminate about 1,000 jobs out of 10,000 or so total employees at Shopify. Most of the affected roles are in recruiting, support and sales, Lutke said in a memo posted on the company’s website.

Shopify reports second quarter earnings Wednesday.

The layoffs boost the likelihood that Shopify will lower its full-year outlook, according to RBC Capital Markets analyst Paul Treiber. During first-quarter results in May, the company said it had expected merchants to join its platform at the same rate as in 2021.

“Since Shopify reinvests all the gross profit that it generates back into the business, the reduction of head count increases the likelihood that the company reduces its FY22 outlook,” Treiber said in a note to clients.

Analysts expect $1.33 billion in revenue for the period ended June 30, up just 11 per cent from the first quarter.
