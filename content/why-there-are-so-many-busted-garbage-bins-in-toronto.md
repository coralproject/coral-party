Toronto, can’t we do better than … public litter bins covered in graffiti, their broken doors hanging open and garbage spilling from their overstuffed flaps?

There are almost 9,500 on-street garbage receptacles in the city, and a lot of them are in rough shape. Earlier this year Mayor John Tory confessed they’re often so gross he’s afraid to use them, and according to city statistics, residents lodge thousands of calls a year complaining they need to be emptied, repaired or cleaned up.

John Leeson, a retiree in the Bay-Cloverhill neighbourhood, said he used call 311 to report broken or messy bins, but he gave up. “There’s just so many,” he said.

Leeson said he believes the poor state of the bins “brings the whole city down” by encouraging people to litter, and sending the message that municipal government doesn’t pay attention to problems that affect daily lives.

“What does it say about the city if it can’t keep garbage off the sidewalks?” he asked.

Long-time city hall watchers say the root of the problem is a penny-pinching decision council reached 15 years ago.

The deal, approved in 2007, made Astral Media responsible for installation and maintenance of Toronto’s litter bins as well as other “street furniture” like transit shelters and benches.

At the time, proponents framed it as a creative way to save the city money. Over its 20-year term, Astral, a division of Bell Media, agreed to install and maintain about $200-million worth of street furniture. In return, the company was granted the right to sell advertising space on transit shelters and info pillars, guaranteeing the city more than $400 million in revenue. The city retained responsibility for collecting trash from the bins.

While the deal looked financially attractive, Matthew Blackett, civic advocate and founder of Spacing Magazine, said it’s resulted in substandard service for residents. He argues that the terms give Astral incentive to keep revenue-generating infrastructure like transit shelters, which carry advertising, in good shape, while allowing street furniture that doesn’t carry ads, like litter bins, to fall into disrepair. And he said while Astral is obligated to put a certain number of bins on the streets, there aren’t enough to meet demand, which means they fill up quickly.

“We need twice as many bins on the street than we currently have and they need to be picked up and maintained,” he said.

Last year alone, Toronto received more than 3,000 calls about overflowing on-street bins, and more than 4,500 complaints about receptacles needing cleaning or repairs, according to city statistics.

Both the city and Astral said the company is meeting contractual standards that require it to clean and inspect the bins as often as twice a week. A spokesperson for Astral noted that the number and placement of the bins is decided by the city, but the company is “committed to working closely” with the municipality “to address any issues brought forward to us.”

The city said that 97 per cent of the time, municipal staff meet the target of responding to reports of overflowing bins within 24 hours. Lisa Duncan, director of the city’s litter services, said overflowing bins can be caused by different factors like good weather and local events that draw crowds, while how often they can be emptied is constrained by issues like pedestrian and vehicle traffic.

But Blackett maintains the street furniture contract is a prime example of how public services are degraded when the city doesn’t properly invest in them.

Infrastructure like trash receptacles are “basic, simple amenities that the city should be providing” and ensuring meet citizens’ needs, he said.
