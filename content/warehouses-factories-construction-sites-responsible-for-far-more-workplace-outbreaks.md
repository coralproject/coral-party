Patios are open. Wait, no — they’re closed. Can you get a haircut? Maybe next month, but probably not.

Ontario’s relentless focus on restaurants, salons and retailers during the province’s recent lockdown seems to indicate that they are the businesses responsible for the third wave currently sweeping the province. However, an analysis of workplace outbreak data shows that’s not the case.

According to data from Toronto Public Health, a full 68 per cent of all workplace COVID-19 outbreaks so far have taken place in offices, warehouses, construction sites and food processing plants — many of which have continued to operate throughout the pandemic — leading many to question why Premier Doug Ford keeps opening and closing restaurants and salons while doing little to stop the rampant transmission happening at workplaces outside of the public eye.

Public-health experts and advocates note that it’s the privileged who have been confined to their homes, while workers at manufacturing plants and warehouses continue to go to their jobs, fearful of losing a day’s pay if they fall ill. Meanwhile, other low-paid workers and small business owners in sectors like food service have been prey to an unpredictable ebb and flow of restrictions that at this point feels endless.

Given where the workplace outbreaks are occurring, many say it’s past time for a pivot in workplace protections like paid sick leave, and ramping up on-site testing and vaccinations will be required to prevent the spread of COVID-19 workplaces where the virus is spreading.

Zain Chagla, an infectious diseases physician at St. Joseph’s Healthcare in Hamilton and an associate professor at McMaster University, said the data clearly shows that regardless of restrictions, it’s the low-paid, vulnerable workers who are driving the third wave in Ontario.

“They’re the ones being put in the front lines while we’re staying at home,” he said.

Zain Chagla, an infectious diseases physician at St. Joseph's Healthcare in Hamilton and an associate professor at McMaster University, said the data clearly shows that regardless of restrictions, it's the low-paid, vulnerable workers who are driving the third wave in Ontario.

Ryan Mallough, director of provincial affairs for Ontario at the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said the data on workplace outbreaks is “frustrating” for small business owners, who have borne the brunt of flip-flopping restrictions while warehouses and manufacturers, as well as many big stores, have gone relatively unscathed.

The cumulative data shows far fewer outbreaks in retail, restaurants and personal services, he said — it’s clear that “you can’t say that we caused the spike.” He does acknowledge that’s in part, however, because many have been closed for long stretches during the pandemic.

Since mid-February, Toronto Public Health has been publishing a list of active workplace outbreaks every Thursday. The agency’s data shows that since the pandemic began, food processing plants, offices, warehouses, shipping and distribution centres and construction sites have been responsible for 378 outbreaks as of March 30 — compared to 51 in bars, restaurants and nightclubs, and 53 in retail, grocery stores and malls. (An official outbreak is declared when there are two or more confirmed cases that could be reasonably linked to the workplace within 14 days.)

That’s 68 per cent of all workplace outbreaks, compared to just under 19 per cent if you combine bars, restaurants, nightclubs, retail, grocery and malls.

The province breaks its sector-specific data down by case, not by outbreak, but the effect is the same. Within the same time frame, Ontario reported 3,266 cases linked to food processing and “other” workplaces, which includes offices, warehouses, distribution centres and construction sites. By comparison, it reported 824 cases linked to bars, restaurants and nightclubs, and 1,339 cases linked to retail.

Since TPH began publishing workplace outbreaks, four of the city’s largest have been at food manufacturers or distributors: Belmont Meats (94 cases), Johnvince Foods (83 cases), Dimpflmeier Bakery (53 cases) and Maple Leaf Foods (25 cases). Union representatives told the Star in February that at least two of the employers — Belmont and Maple Leaf — do not offer paid sick leave.

Outbreaks at two separate Toronto police facilities involving 35 cases forced Toronto Police College to suspend in-person training in February. Other major Toronto workplace outbreaks in the past three months have included Alumicor Limited (20 cases), DECIEM skin care (18 cases), Sky Window Technologies (20 cases), Sweet Maple Candies (17 cases) and Ya Ya Foods (12 cases).

Public-health experts and labour advocates have made clear what they believe is the best way to curb workplace outbreaks: paid sick leave, so that vulnerable, low-income workers don’t go to work sick for fear of losing their job or a day’s pay.

The problem is, the province isn’t listening.

Advocates and public-health officials — even Toronto’s mayor, John Tory — have been calling for paid sick leave, but the Ford government has continuously refused to legislate them, pointing instead to the federal emergency sickness benefit.

Deena Ladd, executive director of the Workers’ Action Centre, said the federal sickness benefit, while helpful for workers taking a week or more off due to a COVID-19 infection, is not comprehensive or swift enough to make up for a sudden day off, say if a worker needs to get tested.

“The medical community is becoming louder and louder and louder in its condemnation of the government in not instituting basic paid sick day coverage as a primary deterrent to workplace infection,” Ladd said.

“They are ignoring the evidence, they’re ignoring the advice they’re getting.”

Epidemiologist and assistant professor at the Faculty of Information at the University of Toronto Colin Furness said for the workers we call “essential” the lockdown restrictions haven’t made much of a difference, especially in geographic areas with high concentrations of these workers.

“Peel is stacked full of essential workers who are going to work anyways,” he said.

“If you want to have an impact in that group, there’s only one thing you can do, I think, which is paid sick days.”

Furness has been calling for mass testing at workplaces as an alternative to lockdowns since last summer. But even that wouldn’t be fully effective without paid sick leave, he said — rapid tests are not as reliable as regular COVID-19 tests, which means a positive rapid test would need to be followed up by a full test, requiring time off for the worker.

Furness agrees with what small business advocates like the CFIB have been saying for months: closing small businesses completely while keeping large stores and companies open doesn’t make much sense. But we’re in too deep now, he added: at this point, if we opened indoor dining, for example, “we would be out of control.”

Tim Sly, an epidemiologist and professor at Ryerson University’s School of Public Health, said via email that the government needs to ramp up its rapid testing capabilities in order to make workplaces, schools, summer camps and businesses safer as Ontario moves into the summer.

Without rapid testing, he said, “we are going to see incidence rise, and all the things we were worried about in the (second) wave will take place again, this time with younger people.”

Mallough said the Ontario government needs to seriously consider its current vaccine strategy, and pivot to make sure hard-hit populations, such as low-income workers, are vaccinated quickly.

Chagla said though making vaccines easily available to workers would be a good start, more work needs to be done to address vaccine hesitancy among vulnerable populations.

“If you took a bunch of vaccines to a factory and said ‘line up,’ you wouldn’t get 100 per cent of people coming in,” he said. “You’d probably only get maybe half of them.”

Chagla said the Ford government missed the opportunity over the past six months to enact stronger workplace controls that could have prevented both the outbreaks in essential workplaces and the reviled see-sawing restrictions.

Before the end of April, Furness thinks Ontario could see a lockdown that would actually affect the workers in “essential” workplaces, not just restaurants, bars, gyms and salons.

“We might end up with sort of a more Wuhan-style, everyone’s at home, everything is shut down,” he said, referring to Wuhan’s 76-day lockdown in early 2020. “We actually might get there.”

“We’ve misfocused a lot of our efforts, and we have not been paying nearly enough attention to workplaces,” Furness said.

“We should be on top of it with enforcement, we should be on top of it with closing, we should be on top of it with testing, and in some cases … we should be on top of the vaccination.”
