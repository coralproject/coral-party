Not since the Cronut craze of 2013 have I seen a singular pastry make such a big splash like the circular croissant has.

I first noticed them this summer when I saw people snake around Le Beau Croissanterie in Regent Park to get one. They’re croissants but not crescent-shaped. They’re round, as if Cinderella’s fairy godmother waved her wand over a hockey puck and it transformed into a coil of pastry dough.

Then I started seeing these croissants pop up at other bakeries across the GTA, creeping into display cases of viennoiserie. At some bakeries, like Bake Code, they’re called swirl croissants with cream fillings such as matcha-yuzu and tiramisu. In Thornhill, Amadeaus Patisserie calls them wheel croissants with flavours like mango-passionfruit and St. Honoré. The new location of Geste Croissanterie on Queen Street West has iterations filled with pistachio-raspberry and pistachio-fig cream.

As with most trends nowadays, this one started online. Look up “viral croissant Toronto” on TikTok and many videos feature Kensington Market’s Little Pebbles bakery as users film themselves ripping one of these creamed-filled croissants as they answer the question written across the screen: “Are these viral croissants worth the hype?” (Spoiler: they always say yes.)

As with a lot of food trends that hit Toronto, this one started in New York City. The circular croissant’s popularity is largely credited to Lafayette Grand Cafe and Bakery in NoHo, which introduced theirs, calling it the Suprême croissant, in April 2022. At first the bakery sold a few dozen of them before it started making the rounds on social media a month later: a quick search on TikTok will yield dozens of young foodies filming themselves eating the Suprême, totalling more than 10 million views.

But, how do they taste?
So, they look cool on a phone screen, but how do they taste?

For the most part they all share a similar texture of the classic buttery croissant with a flaky, delicate exterior and a fluffy interior crumb. Compared to a regular croissant, these circular ones have a larger surface area than regular croissants, giving them a higher crust-to-crumb ratio. Croissant purists will scoff, but in the grand scheme of viral desserts, this is low on the offensive meter.

“The texture is going to be different. The honeycomb is a bit denser because unlike a regular croissant that freely expands, this is baked in a mould,” says Geste’s co-owner Virgyl Fernandes.

In essence, a roll of croissant dough is placed into a small cake ring sandwiched by two perforated pans so it holds a uniform shape as it bakes. It’s the cream filling and size of the croissants where the bakeries diverge. Bake Code opts for flavours popular in East Asian desserts such as yuzu-matcha and Tiramisu (the latter is popular at Korean bingsu and Japanese pancake spots).

At Amadeus Patisserie, co-owner Anat Aronovich said they took existing flavours their bakery was known for and incorporated them into the wheel croissants they — pun intended — rolled out in June. On busy days, they make about 200.

“The croissant dough is classic, flakey, buttery, playing with the shape makes it more fun but you’re still retaining the taste and integrity,” said Aronovich.

Fernandes adds that croissant dough is versatile. “I opened a whole business on the croissant,” he said, pointing out that before the pandemic, croissants with streaks of colour were popular as well as croffles, croissant dough cooked in a waffle iron.

At Kensington Market’s Little Pebbles, owner Sahi Garg has tried them all: cube-croissants, colour-streaked croissants, croissants shaped like pyramids, croissants filled with soft serve, croissants made in a waffle iron, and of course, the supreme croissants.

Garg says that most people who come into his bakery are international visitors who often see pastry trends from around the world. He’s already working on what he thinks will be the next big thing — literally: a giant, one-kilogram croissant going for $25.

The demand for round croissants has died down since the summer, though the bakeries I spoke to said they don’t plan on dropping them yet as sales are steady. During the times I was at Little Pebbles, there were a steady rotating door of people coming in asking about their wheel croissants.

It’s all a bit surreal for Lafayette executive pastry chef Scott Cioe, who popularized the circular croissant a year ago with fellow Lafayette baker James Belisle, calling it the Suprême.

“It’s a blessing, I’ve been seeing (the Supreme) on almost every continent — Australia, Africa. What I love is seeing people create their own flavours and see the idea spread in real time (online),” Cioe said.

The lines have calmed down at Layfette since then, though they still do seasonal flavours. But as its popularity continues elsewhere, Cioe has no intention of a trademark or putting a copyright on the Suprême.

“No, it’s too late for that,” Cioe said with a laugh. “It’s just a croissant, it’s not that serious.”
