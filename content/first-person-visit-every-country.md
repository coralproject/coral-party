Hi I'm Graham Hughes, British adventurer, filmmaker and the first person to visit every country (all UN member states plus Palestine, Kosovo, Taiwan and Vatican City) without flying... an adventure that took over 4 years and encompassed over 215 countries and territories.

I travelled alone, without any professional support (save that of my wonderful family and friends) and on a shoestring budget of Â£100 ($150) a week.

Along the way I was jailed in Africa (twice - once in Cape Verde, once in Congo), watched one of the last space shuttles take off, ran the US blockade to get into Cuba, joined a Bwiti tribe in Gabon, was helped by Maoist rebels in Nepal, danced with the Highlanders of Papua New Guinea, swam in the famous jellyfish lake of Palau and climbed to the top of the Great Pyramid of Giza.

Lovely Americans can finally watch the adventure unfold THIS AFTERNOON on Travel Channel from 12|11c... 8 back-to-back episodes of "Lonely Planet: Odyssey with Graham Hughes" covering the first year of my travels from Uruguay to Egypt. If enough people watch it (and subsequently bug @TravelChannel for more), they might let me broadcast years 2-4, which would include my forays into Iraq, Afghanistan, Eritrea and North Korea (kinda).

I've done three of these AMAs before, the first two are pretty crap because I was rushed and I didn't really know what I was doing (sorry!), but the one I did in November 2014 is pretty good - there's a round-up that somebody did here: http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2014/12/01/he-filled-four-passports-and-went-to-jail-twice-traveling-the-world-without-flying-read-what-he-just-revealed-about-his-journey/ - you might want to read it before asking a question in case I've already answered it!!

The blog of my journey can be found at: http://www.theodysseyexpedition.com/ - it's rather comprehensive!

Here's a second of me in every country: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pdZhbsyOSw

Ooh, and by the way, after I finished my adventure I won a small private Caribbean island on a gameshow. It's called Jinja Island, it's in Bocas Del Toro, Panama and it's on AirBnB if you're in the neighbourhood!
