Mama Duck, the world’s largest rubber duck that swims in at six storeys and weighs over 13,600 kilograms, is set for a return to Toronto’s waterfront in September.

It’s the first paddle-back to Toronto in six years for the popular icon scheduled for Sept. 16 and 17 appearances at Queens Quay East to celebrate the Toronto Waterfront Festival (formerly Redpath Waterfront Festival).

“The number one program we continually get asked to bring back is by far the World’s Largest Rubber Duck,” said Nancy Gavin, chair of the Toronto Waterfront Festival, in a news release.

The Toronto Waterfront Festival is an annual summer event with music, food, nautical programs and entertainment organized in partnership with the Waterfront BIA. The 2023 festival partners will include Redpath Sugar, The Waterfront BIA, Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport, Waterfront Toronto and Queen’s Quay Terminal.

The inflatable duck’s last appearance was in 2017 when it splashed its way into waterfront visitors’ hearts for Canada’s 150th anniversary celebration.

However, Mama Duck also sparked some criticism that year, given it cost the province $120,000 to rent from July until August, and the fact that it’s not related to anything Canadian.

According to the Toronto Waterfront Festival news release, more than 750,000 people attended the three-day celebration in 2017 and the festival generated about $7.6 million for the city.

That year, 75 per cent of festival attendees said the rubber duck was their main reason for attending.
