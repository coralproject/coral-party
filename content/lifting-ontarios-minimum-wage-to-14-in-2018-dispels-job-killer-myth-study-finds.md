Lifting Ontario’s minimum wage to $14 in 2018 dispels ‘job killer’ myth, study finds
The Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives found the minimum wage increase didn’t hurt the economy and it especially helped women of colour.

Raising the minimum wage in 2018 wasn’t the job killer many business lobbyists’ espoused at the time. It did the opposite. While wages grew, total employment increased, reducing the racialized wage gap, especially for women, a new study says.

The Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives released its findings Tuesday which show that when minimum wage increased to $14 in 2018, employment also increased by 1.7 per cent in 2018 and by 2.8 per cent in 2019.

The study, funded by the Canadian Race Relations Foundation, found that across the Ontario economy, the average hourly wage rate increased by 3.4 per cent between 2017 and 2018. All industries with lower-than-average wages — which in 2018 was $27.28 — except for agriculture and manufacturing, had increases in employment.

“There was a lot of concern and conversation from the business lobby about how this would be a job killer and would not benefit low income individuals,” said Sheila Block, senior economist and author of the study. “We knew from the more recent academic literature that it wasn’t the case.”

On Dec. 31, 2017, Ontario’s general minimum wage increased from $11.60 per hour to $14, affecting one million Ontario workers under Bill 148, the “Fair Workplaces, Better Jobs Act.” Another raise hike to $15 was slated for 2019 but the Ford government revoked it, later implementing it on Jan. 1, 2022.

A major finding in the study showed as a result of the gendered nature of low-wage work, wage gains were larger for women than they were for men across all racialized groups. On an hourly basis, the estimated increases for Black women (4.9 per cent) and racialized women (4.7 per cent) outpaced those for non-racialized men (3.4 per cent).

“When you spend time thinking about the occupational structure of employment for racialized and non-racialized Ontario workers, it becomes pretty clear that racialized people and particularly women are overrepresented in low wage jobs,” Block said. “So it’s expected that a policy which lifts all minimum income workers would have a positive impact particularly for racialized women.”

Increasing the minimum wage also had a knock-on effect for low-wage workers.

The data suggests that the increase in the minimum wage had a positive impact on workers who were earning just above the minimum wage in 2017 — between $11.60 and $14 an hour.

Their share of total employment rose from 7.5 per cent of employees in 2017 to 10.1 per cent in 2018 to 11.9 per cent in 2019, and the number of employees in this earning bracket increased as well.

“I call this the trickle up effect,” said Jim Stanford, an economist and director at Centre for Future Work. “Many jobs’ wages are set in relation to the minimum wage. For those that wanted to pay a little bit more than minimum wage, they also had to increase their wages to attract more workers.”

Another key finding showed that 70 per cent of minimum-wage workers benefiting from a raise were adults, contradicting the notion that these workers are mostly teenagers at the start of their working lives.

There was a sharp increase in the share of minimum-wage workers 25 years of age or older between 2017 and 2018, from 41 per cent to 50 per cent — it shows that a number of adult workers benefited from the wage increase.

“This busts another myth that minimum wages only matters for teenagers,” Stanford said. “It affects lots of adults and working families.”

However, he said while the study dispels the notion that increased minimum wage creates job loss, the level of employment in the labour market has “almost nothing to do with minimum wage.”

While it can help in certain sectors including hospitality and retail to attract more workers, the overall trend in employment is driven by stronger forces.

“You have to look at the microeconomic condition of the economy, level of business investment, trend of exports, levels of government spending, those determine how many people are working not how much people are paid,” he said.

Jean-François Perrault, senior vice-president and chief economist at Scotiabank, said during 2017 to 2019 the labour market in Ontario was “very strong” making it difficult to perceive any negative impact minimum wage increase would impose on the economy, but that doesn’t mean the increase didn’t have an impact.

“The improvements to employment during this time could have happened anyway given the strength of the labour market,” he said.

“It’s one thing to raise the minimum wage when the economy is in a terrible place but when it’s tight like it was in 2018 and 2019 wages naturally rise. So hiking wages in that environment has a different impact, because there was already pressure to increase wages,” Perrault said.

However, the two main findings of the study still shed light on important economic issues, Block said.

“At the time there was a massive debate whether minimum wage increases would have a negative impact on low-wage workers, this disproves that,” she said.

The other finding proves that due to the gendered and racialized nature of low-wage work, wage gains were greater for women than men, and in particular for racialized women and Black women.

“This is an important finding in the report; the disproportionate impact felt by racialized women.”
