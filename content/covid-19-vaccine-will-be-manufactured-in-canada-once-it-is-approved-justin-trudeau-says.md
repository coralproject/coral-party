A COVID-19 vaccine will be manufactured in Canada this year pending regulatory approval, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced Tuesday.

Speaking to reporters in Ottawa, Trudeau said “tens of millions” of doses of a COVID-19 vaccine from American-based company Novavax will be made in Canada pending Health Canada approval.

To date, Canada has had to rely on production overseas to get its hands on COVID-19 doses. Both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines — the two so far approved for use in Canada — are manufactured in Europe.

Trudeau said the government signed a memorandum of understanding with Novavax to produce their COVID-19 vaccines at the new National Research Council facility in Montreal.

He said construction at the facility, made possible with funding from the federal government, should be completed by the summer. Trudeau said the facility, once completed, will be able to produce about 2 million doses of vaccines per month.

“We need as much domestic capacity for vaccine production as possible,” Trudeau said.

Maryland-based Novavax applied Friday to start the regulatory review process for its experimental vaccine, after announcing a clinical trial in the United Kingdom showed it was more than 89 per cent effective against COVID-19.

The trial in the U.K. showed significant effectiveness against both the original virus behind COVID-19, and the variant known as B. 1.17 that was first identified there. A smaller phase two trial in South Africa showed the vaccine was also effective against a variant that first emerged there, known as B. 1.351.
