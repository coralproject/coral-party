Which animals are “willing” to get the jab? Which will throw a tantrum when the needle comes their way?

Those are the questions veterinarians at zoos across Canada are asking themselves as they get set to give vulnerable species a COVID-19 vaccine specially designed for animals.

At the Toronto Zoo, veterinary staff are already planning their vaccination campaign, with a shipment of 320 doses expected to arrive in the coming days. Some 146 animals at the zoo will receive the vaccine, administered in two doses spaced two to three weeks apart.

Besides Toronto Zoo, other Canadian facilities receiving shipments of the vaccine include Winnipeg’s Assiniboine Zoo, the Calgary Zoo, the Vancouver Aquarium and Montreal’s Granby Zoo.

Can animals actually catch COVID-19?

The rollout of the vaccine for animals comes after several high-profile deaths due to COVID-19 at zoos across the U.S. In November, three snow leopards at the Lincoln Children’s Zoo in Nebraska died of complications from COVID-19. Another snow leopard at the Miller Park Zoo in Illinois died in January after contracting the virus.

According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, there have been 397 confirmed cases of COVID-19 among animals in the U.S. — the majority of which were found in cats and dogs.

In Canada, 43 animals have tested positive for the virus, according to the Canadian Animal Health Surveillance System. Most of the cases were detected in November and December 2021 and were found in wild white-tailed deer populations.

Jim Facette, executive director of Canada’s Accredited Zoos and Aquariums (CAZA), said zero animals at the organization’s 26 accredited zoos and aquariums have tested positive for the virus.

“They have put in place the best safety measures,” Facette said. “Protocols that were put in place throughout this entire pandemic have been shared across Canada amongst our membership.”

Which animals are at risk?

Chris Enright, head veterinarian at Winnipeg’s Assiniboine Zoo, recalls about a year ago when the global veterinary community learned that snow leopards were particularly susceptible to catching COVID-19.

“Overnight, the professional zoo community was changing how we manage our snow leopards in order to layer the protections for that particular species and keep them safe in our care,” he said. There is still no concrete answer why the species is at a high risk of contracting the virus, Enright noted.

Among those on the priority list at Toronto Zoo are some high-profile names: Sekali, a 29-year-old pregnant Sumatran orangutan, her 54-year old compadre Puppe, a Sumatran orangutan who is the oldest of her species in North America, and 50-year-old silverback gorilla Charles, whose avant-garde paintings have fetched up to $1,000 apiece.

In addition to the orangutans and gorillas, other species set to receive the vaccine are the zoo’s snow leopards, lions, tigers and black-footed ferrets — mammals that are particularly susceptible to contracting the virus.

“A lot of those are high-profile animals for us,” said Dolf DeJong, CEO of the Toronto Zoo. “Our first step is to ensure our high-risk animals are receiving those vaccines.”

How do you give an animal the jab?

Though Assiniboine Park Zoo received its supply of vaccines just two weeks ago, Enright said preparations began months in advance.

“Our snow leopards knew that if they stood there and they got poked, they’d get a reward at the end,” said Enright. Video shared by the zoo also showed a camel obliviously enjoying a meal while staff administered the shot.

A camel at Winnipeg's Assiniboine Park Zoo receives a COVID-19 vaccine made specifically for animals.

Other animals, however, are less co-operative, Enright said, noting that the zoo’s population of aging squirrel monkeys will need to be given the vaccination under anesthesia during their annual physical examination.

“It can be quite challenging sometimes to simply hang on to some of our animals in order to obtain that blood sample or vaccinate,” he said.

Who developed the vaccine?

Zoetis, a U.S.-based animal health drug company, is donating more than 26,000 doses of the COVID-19 vaccine to more than 220 zoos, sanctuaries and animal conservatories around the world.

“Zoetis initiated development activities for a new vaccine in early 2020 when the first dog was reported to be infected with COVID-19 in Hong Kong,” spokesperson Christina Lood said in an email. A study conducted on dogs and cats found the vaccine to be safe and effective in mounting an immune response to the virus.

The vaccine, which Lood said is “uniquely formulated for animals,” uses subunit recombinant technology — a similar mechanism found in the Novavax and AstraZeneca vaccines, which include a small piece of genetic material from the virus.

In January 2021, Zoetis donated the experimental vaccine for emergency use among the Great Ape population at the San Diego Zoo. It has since been administered to other types of animals.
