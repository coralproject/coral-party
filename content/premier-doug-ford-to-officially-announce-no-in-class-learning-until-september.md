After days of deliberation, Premier Doug Ford is finally set to officially announce that Ontario schools will not reopen to in-class learning until September.

Along with Health Minister Christine Elliott and Education Minister Stephen Lecce, Ford will share the news with pandemic-weary Ontarians at 1 p.m Wednesday.

As first reported by the Star, the premier’s decision comes after public health officials advised him schools could only reopen if the broader opening of the economy is delayed by at least two weeks.

“Our plan for step one of the reopening allows many more outdoor activities, which everyone agrees are very safe, while indoor activities are still questionable,” a senior official, speaking confidentially in order to discuss internal deliberations, said Wednesday morning.

“We need the numbers to continue to decline, as they are,” the insider said, referring to the daily case counts of COVID-19 that are now well below 1,000.

“The best way to impact the mental health of the most amount of people — for the better — is to get cases and numbers and down and get to step one as fast as possible. Something we know from every doctor —would be delayed by opening schools.”

Mindful that parents and schoolchildren are clamouring to return to classes — for educational and social reasons — the official stressed there is much more to reopening the economy than just allowing outdoor dining on restaurant patios.

“Retail shops opening at only 15 per cent capacity will help over 1 million people have a shot at a personal recovery too, while kids can now gather in groups of up to 10 outdoors,” the source said.

It also clears the way for summer camps and youth sporting activities, the insider added.

“Getting to step one and step two (when services like barbershops and hair and nail salons can again open) as soon as possible helps the most people in the biggest ways.”

Only 26 per cent of Ontarians have children in the school system — with 14 per cent having elementary-aged kids — meaning Ford has to weigh that against the huge majority of people that would be affected if the economy remains shuttered.

“That’s what we’re facing,” the premier told Progressive Conservative MPPs during a two-hour virtual caucus meeting Tuesday.

One Tory MPP, who asked not to be named because the member was breaking caucus confidences, conceded that Ford has vacillated.

“There’s a serious problem when the leadership can’t explain the thought processes of their decisions,” the member said, adding Ontarians are fed up and just want things to reopen quickly and safely.

On Monday evening, cabinet’s policy and priorities committee recommended students continue learning online from home because the school year ends soon.

The full cabinet will give the stamp of approval Wednesday morning. That’s the same day Ontario’s stay-at-home order officially ends.

Ontario, which has been under a state of emergency since mid-April, could enter the first stage of reopening the economy as early as this Monday.

By Friday, it will be two weeks past the necessary threshold of 60 per cent of adults having received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine.

With that hurdle cleared, the criteria set out by public health officials would be met for Ontario to safely enter the first stage of reopening a week earlier than the June 14 date previously set.

That would allow restaurant patios to reopen, more retail shops to welcome customers inside at 15 per cent capacity, and groups of up to 10 people from different households to gather outside.

But Ontario would be the only province in the country where classrooms remain closed and all students learning online.

According to confidential data obtained by the Star on Tuesday, elementary schools were the biggest source of COVID-19 outbreaks over 30 days ending April 20 with 365.

That was ahead of workplaces at 338 and child care centres with 174. There were 64 outbreaks at high schools.

Dr. David Williams, the chief medical officer of health, regional medical officers, and members of the science table agree it is safe to return to in-class learning, but only if nothing else reopens.

Last Friday, Dr. Eileen de Villa, Toronto’s chief medical officer of health, said “our preference is that the restoration of in-person learning should precede the lifting of any other restrictions implemented to reduce COVID-19 transmission.”

Ford wrote Williams, de Villa, and public health officials and educators last Thursday seeking “consensus” about the wisdom of having kids indoors.

Sam Hammond, president of the Elementary Teachers’ Federation of Ontario, has suggested it is not safe for his members to resume teaching indoors.

“Ford and the (Ministry of Health) determined that it was only safe for 550 people who are fully vaccinated to attend the Leaf game tonight in an arena that holds 20,000,” Hammond tweeted on Monday.

“Now they are deciding if 550 (education) workers and students, with maybe one vaccination, can gather in a school that holds 550 people.”
