Welcome to our NBA trade deadline live blog. Below you’ll find all the news, rumours and reaction from one of the most exciting days on the sports calendar — and a potentially busy one for the Toronto Raptors. Stick with us and refresh for updates through to the 3 p.m. trade deadline.

2:38 p.m.: Catching up on minor deals
A flurry of trades have come in over the last half hour as the 3 p.m. deadline nears. Unfortunately, we can’t type as fast as Adrian Wojnaroski or Shams Charania can.

Here are the reports you need to know:

Spurs send Josh Richardson to the Pelicans for Devonte; Graham and four second-round picks
Lakers trade Patrick Beverley and second-round draft compensation to the Magic for centre Mo Bamba
A three-team trade sees the Rockets acquire former Raptors shooting guard Danny Green and a pick swap, the Clippers receive Eric Gordon and three second-round picks, while the Grizzlies add Luke Kennard. There may be more information to come on this deal.
The Hawks are trading Justin Holiday, Frank Kaminsky and two second-round picks to Houston for Garrison Matthews and Bruno Fernando

2:18 p.m.: Warriors emerge as ‘contender’ for Anunoby
The defending champs have reportedly emerged as a suitor for Raptors forward O.G. Anunoby.

Shams Charania reports that Anunoby has gotten a lot of interest around the league but the Warriors have become a “pretty serious contender” and are looking at options to make a trade.

The Grizzlies and Pelicans also remain interested.

2 p.m.: James Wiseman goes to Motor City
Per ESPN: The Warriors are trading the second overall pick in the 2020 NBA Draft to the Detroit Pistons in a three-way deal that sends forward Saddiq Bey to the Atlanta Hawks and Kevin Knox along with five second-round picks back to Golden State.

1:55 p.m.: Celtics offer for Poeltl revealed
League sources tell MassLive that Boston offered Payton Pritchard, Danilo Gallinari and multiple future second-round picks for the big man ahead of Thursday’s deal.

The Spurs instead took the Raptors’ offer which included a top-6 protected first-round pick for 2024, two future second round picks and center Khem Birch.

Boston was unlikely to be able to top the Raptors’ offer, MassLive reported, even if they added in a first-round pick because that potential pick would likely be lower than Toronto’s future selection due to Boston’s promising long-term outlook.

While Pritchard is an appealing trade asset, Gallinari’s player option for next season was seen as a negative for a rebuilding team in San Antonio with the 34-year-old coming off a torn ACL.

1:52 p.m.: Clippers add young guard
The Nuggets are sending 22-year-old point guard Bones Hyland to the Los Angeles Clippers, according to ESPN. In return, the Clippers will send the Nuggets 2024 and 2025 second-round picks.

1:20 p.m.: Live show recap
Our trade deadline live show on Twitter Spaces was eventful and exciting with tons of listener questions and commentary from Doug Smith. Topics covered included O.G. Anunoby’s trade value, Masai Ujiri’s history of making bold trades, what Fred VanVleet brings off the court, why Scottie Barnes is untouchable, what the Jakob Poeltl trades means, and much more.

1:05 p.m.: VanVleet is the heart of the Raptors
In our live trade deadline show a listener asked Smith if he sees Fred VanVleet as a part of this team’s future plans. Smith had some thoughtful insight on why he might be:

“Regardless of what everyone thinks of Pascal or Scottie, Fred’s the heart. I think they like having him here and I think he likes it here. His numbers are basically back to normal after he played really well the last month. So I think he’s part of it,” Smith said.

He went on to look at the different ways the Raptors can find the money to re-sign VanVleet. Then he gave an example of the value he brings off the court.

“I made this analogy a couple of weeks ago while talking about Barnes, who’s a sublimely talented young player, no question about it. I get that he’s come up big in fourth quarters, but there are players on the team who wonder why he has so many slow starts. My analogy was, that he needs a guy who can slap him around like Charles Oakley came in and slapped Vince around. I don’t know whether that guy exists today anywhere in the NBA, but that’s the kind of thing they need, and I think Fred can be that for Scottie because he’s got the respect of every guy in that room and I think the kid’s going to listen. Because he knows it’s in his best interests. That’s where Fred’s value lies.”

12:55 p.m.: Ibaka finds new home
A couple of minor trade details are starting to trickle through.

Former Raptors player Serge Ibaka, who had requested a trade from Milwaukee, will be going to Indiana as part of the Jae Crowder deal, Shams Charania reports.

Meanwhile, NBA insider Adrian Wojnarowski reports that Indiana is picking up guard George Hill and a second-round pick from the Bucks to absorb Hills $4 million contract.

12:40 p.m.: Thybulle to the Blazers
Chris Haynes reports that the Sixers are sending Matisse Thybulle to the Portland Trail Blazers. That would likely take the Blazers out of the O.G. Anunoby sweepstakes, the Star’s Doug Smith speculates on the Twitter Space live show going on now.

12:35 p.m.: Why move on from Anunoby?
Why would Masai Ujiri would trade O.G. Anunoby when he’s everything he loves about a player? It’s a question brought up by a listener in our live deadline show. Without hesitation, Smith responded:

“You trade him in a second if it will help improve this team,” he said, noting that being sentimental is not part of the Raptors president’s DNA.

“He traded Serge Ibaka. He traded Kyle Lowry. He traded DeMar DeRozan ... Masai is a great guy, I have the upmost respect for him, but he is ruthless and the sentimentality is not a factor. Maybe it hurts him, and it might be hard, but he’s going to do what he has to do. He might love a player, but he can love them from afar.”

12:28 p.m.: Scottie Barnes going nowhere
In our NBA trade deadline live show, Doug Smith shot down any chance of the Raptors trading prized sophomore Scottie Barnes.

“He’s too valuable, is too good and has too good a contract. It doesn’t make sense.”

12:20 p.m.: More Lakers moves
The L.A. Lakers are trading Thomas Bryant to Denver for Davon Reed and three second-round picks, ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski reports. Seems like second-round picks are being tossed like candy right now.

Speaking of candy, I’m getting hungry. Can we pause the trades for five minutes?

12:15 p.m.: Pacers jump in
This Jae Crowder trade is getting more complicated. NBA insider Shams Charania says Indiana is also part of the deal, with the Pacers acquiring Bucks’ Jordan Nwora and two second-rounders as part of the trade.

12:05 p.m.: What’s behind the Poeltl trade?
In our NBA trade deadline live show, Doug Smith was asked to share his thoughts on the Poeltl trade: “It signals a shift away from the everybody is six-foot-nine strategy they’ve been rolling with.

“For now it makes them more a traditional, balanced team. I think they paid a lot for this and the jury is out on how it plays out long term.”

They paid a lot, but did they pay too much? Smith says that will depend on how much they have to pay to extend Poeltl’s contract this summer.

12:02 p.m.: Durant trade expanding
It looks like the Kevin Durant blockbuster trade is expanding. NBA insider Shams Charania is reporting that the Milwaukee Bucks are acquiring Jae Crowder in a trade to the Nets for five second-round picks. The Phoenix Suns sent Crowder to the Nets as part of a monster package for Durant, that included Cam Johnson, Mikal Bridges, and four first-round picks.

12:08 p.m.: Celtics add a shooter
The Boston Celtics made a smaller splash by acquiring big-man Mike Muscala from the Oklahoma City Thunder, reports Shams Charania. The Celtics are sending Justin Jackson and two second-round picks back to the Thunder.

Muscala is a centre who attempts over three three-pointers a game and is shooting at a .394 clip from long range this season.

11:38 a.m.: Lillard staying put
In a week full of superstar swaps, one big name will be staying put. Trail Blazers superstar Damian Lillard will not be traded today despite teams calling Portland to ask about his availability, according to Chris Haynes.

The Blazers moved Josh Hart to the Knicks on Wednesday but with a 27-28 record, they sit in 10th place in the Western Conference and have a shot to secure a play-in spot in the post-season.

11:30 a.m.: Our live show is starting soon
As NBA trade news and rumours continue to swirl across the Twitter timeline, basketball fans are sitting in suspense as the 3 p.m. ET trade deadline inches closer.

Our NBA trade deadline live show begins at 12 p.m. ET, where we’ll break down everything that’s happened so far and what might be coming in the hours ahead.

11 a.m.: Shining on the biggest stage
VanVleet, of course, is one of the team’s last connections to the 2019 championship title. Here’s the Star’s Gilbert Ngabo looking back on that magical time.

VanVleet’s career signature moment likely came in Game 6 of the NBA Final in 2019.

VanVleet hit a huge three-point shot to give the Raptors a 104-101 lead with less than four minutes left against the Warriors in Oakland. A TV camera caught VanVleet, sporting stitches under his right eye, letting out a primal scream after making the shot, a moment forever captured in franchise lore.

VanVleet’s play in the fourth quarter of that game helped seal the Raptors championship. He scored 12 points (including three three-pointers) while defending Stephen Curry who went 1-5 in the final frame.

Coming off the bench, VanVleet finished the game with a playoff career-high 22 points, drilling five long-distance shots. Kawhi Leonard was the Finals MVP trophy but it wasn’t a unanimous selection, because VanVleet’s play in the series earned him a single vote.

VanVleet also famously lost a tooth in Game 4 of the NBA Finals when Golden State’s Shaun Livingston inadvertently him with his elbow, giving him a black eye as well.

10:45 a.m.: Luxury tax troubles
One of the topics that might come up in the chat is that the Raptors, as currently constructed, have three big players who will be unrestricted free agents this summer — Poeltl, VanVleet and Trent. All three are in line for a huge payday. That would push the Raptors into the luxury tax territory for a team that’s in 10th place right now in the East.

Does that put pressure on the Raptors to deal VanVleet or Trent today to make sure they get something back, instead of just letting them go to another team this summer?

10:30 a.m.: Countdown to Raptors chat
If you’re following this blog, I’m sure you’re dying to talk basketball. Join Raptors reporter Doug Smith today at 12 p.m. on Twitter Spaces for his thoughts on Poeltl coming back, the Durant blockbuster, Westbrook’s next NBA home and so much more.

10 a.m.: Dramatic buzzer-beater
Anunoby, of course, hit one of the biggest shots in Raptors franchise history. The Star’s Gilbert Ngabo looks back at this magical moment:

A year removed from the NBA championship, and in a fan-less arena because of pandemic restrictions, the Raptors were in danger of falling into a 3-0 hole against Boston Celtics in the second round of the 2020 playoffs.

With 0.5 seconds left, and the Raptors trailing by two points, it seemed all but over as Toronto inbounded the ball after a timeout. Kyle Lowry miraculously threw the ball cross-court over the outstretched arms of seven-foot-five centre Tacko Fall to Anunoby, who let it fly without hesitation.

By the time the ball swished through the net, no time was left on the game clock. Anunoby calmly strode toward the middle of the court as if nothing had happened, while his teammates jumped all over him in celebration. Anunoby would cap it off with a legendary quote.

“I expected to make it,” he told reporters. “I don’t shoot trying to miss.”

(That quote has to go down as one of the most memorable quotes ever by a Toronto sports figure. Right up there with Josh Donaldson’s “This isn’t the ‘try’ league; it’s the ‘get it done’ league” and sprinter Ben Johnson’s “When the gun go off, the race be over.”)

9:30 a.m.: Raptors win vs. Spurs
Oh yeah, there was a game last night! Here’s Doug’s story on the last game before the deadline, a Raptors win over the Spurs. Conveniently enough, Poeltl was in town with the Spurs. It’s not clear at this point when he’ll play his first game with the Raptors. Toronto plays its next three games at home with the Jazz up next on Friday. Utah will be short handed after trading veteran point guard Mike Conley in the three-team trade that sent Russell Westbrook to the Jazz. Westbrook is expected to be bought out by Utah with Chicago a potential landing spot, Chris Haynes reports.

9:15 a.m.: High price?
The Star’s Doug Smith thinks the Raptors paid a high price to bring back Jakob Poetl, depending on the level of protection on the first-round pick. Wojnarowski reports that Toronto made the deal “with an intention of signing him to a new contract this summer.” Do you like the trade? Vote in our poll in Doug’s early morning file.

9 a.m.: Potential deals to ponder
In that same Jan. 23 column, Bruce threw out these potential deals:

Toronto could try to weigh deals for present value, or future picks. Do they inquire into New Orleans first-rounder Dyson Daniels with filler and picks, or Daniels and injury-prone scorer Brandon Ingram? Do the Raptors try a lateral move and inquire into a package for Deandre Ayton and picks from Phoenix? Do they bet on the surgically repaired knee of Chicago’s Zach LaVine? Do they ask Indiana about Myles Turner and Canadian Andrew Nembhard? Denver probably doesn’t move Jamal Murray, right?

8:50 a.m.: What next for O.G.?
The Star’s Bruce Arthur was the first to report that at least one NBA team had offered three first-round picks for Anunoby. Subsequent reports suggested it was the Knicks, although New York denied it. With Durant in the Western Conference now, would Memphis or New Orleans give up three unprotected picks to grab one of the premier defensive stoppers in the league in Anunoby? And would three picks in the 20s be fair value for Toronto? Why trade Anunoby when a contending team would need a player like him?

8:40 a.m.: Anunoby’s value
So many questions with the Raptors following the Durant and Poeltl trades. The Raptors were thought to be one of the teams with the most attractive players for a deal at the deadline. Does the acquisition of Poeltl mean they are hanging on to all their core pieces and make a run for the playoffs after a disappointing season? Or is there another shoe to be dropped today. And here’s ESPN insider Adrian Wojnarowski:

“Toronto’s talks on forward O.G. Anunoby are rolling into the final hours of the trade deadline. The landing of Kevin Durant with the Suns could escalate Anunoby’s value among Western Conference teams pursuing an elite forward to defend Durant.”

8:30 a.m.: Let’s get rolling
Good morning! This is the Star’s deputy sports editor Patrick Ho. You’re either waking up to the jaw-dropping news of the Kevin Durant blockbuster trade — and the Raptors bringing back Jakob Poeltl — or if you’re like me, trying to keep your bleary eyes open because you stayed up when Chris Haynes of Bleacher Report and TNT broke the news of the KD deal at around 1 a.m. Anyway, lots to talk about when the Star’s Doug Smith comes on Twitter Spaces at noon to chat, let’s get this blog rolling in the mean time.

7:20 a.m.: Breaking down Poeltl trade
The Raptors are repatriating a former lottery pick they groomed and trained as they become a more traditional-looking team ahead of Thursday’s NBA trade deadline.

As one of a series of shocking deals that reverberated across the league overnight, the Raptors are re-acquiring centre Jakob Poeltl from the San Antonio Spurs for Khem Birch, a protected 2024 first round draft pick and two future second round draft picks, according to published reports.

The protection on the first-round pick is unknown and will be one of the keys to the longer-term impact of the deal. But Toronto does clear the nearly $7 million owed Birch in the final year of his contract next season, a not unsubstantial sum for a seldom used veteran.

1:10 a.m.: Durant blockbuster
Wake up everyone! Kevin Durant has been traded.

Multiple reports say the Brooklyn Nets superstar has been dealt to the Phoenix Suns.

Heading back to Brooklyn are Mikal Bridges, Cam Johnson, four first-round picks and additional draft compensation, according to reports. The Suns were able to acquire Durant and keep their core of Chris Paul, Devin Booker and Deandre Ayton intact.

12:55 a.m.: Raptors bring back Poeltl
The Raptors made the first move on NBA trade deadline day.

Toronto has reportedly acquired centre Jakob Poeltl from the San Antonio Spurs in exchange for centre Khem Birch, a protected first-round pick in 2024 and two future second-round picks.

Poeltl was drafted ninth overall by Toronto in 2016 and was part of the trade package that brought back Kawhi Leonard in 2018.

ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski reported the news just before 1 a.m. ET on Thursday.

12 a.m.: VanVleet shrugs off trade rumours
As the NBA trade rumour mill churns and his name is more prominent than it’s ever been, he shrugs his shoulders and gets on with his life.

“Obviously my name’s been buzzing around, so I’m sure they’re listening when the calls are coming in,” he said of a Raptors brain trust facing down a 3 p.m. ET Thursday deadline.

“They’re a great front office. Masai (Ujiri) and Bobby (Webster), those guys have earned the trust and respect and certainly have my trust and respect, so whatever happens, happens.”

11:57 p.m. Wednesday: Spurs interested in Banton?
NBA insider Marc Stein has built upon his previous report that the Raptors and Spurs are discussing a potential Jakob Poeltl trade.

According to Stein, discussions have centred on a deal involving Thad Young and draft capital for Poeltl. The Spurs are said to be seeking at least one first-round pick and have interest in Raptors guard Dalano Banton.

Buckle up, Raptors fans.

11 p.m. Wednesday: Live Twitter chat
As if this blog isn’t enough (we promise, it will be worth your while), the Star will be holding a live NBA trade deadline show at 12 p.m. ET on Twitter Spaces.

Hosted by Libaan Osman and featuring Doug Smith, you can listen into the chat on Twitter and will have a chance to ask a question.

Full details on our live show can be found here: Doug Smith answers your questions on Twitter Spaces Thursday at 12 p.m. ET

10:31 p.m. Wednesday: Wall out
Where will John Wall play next?

The veteran guard is reportedly on his way out of Los Angeles, according to Marc Stein, as the Clippers are looking to trade him. If they can’t? Stein reports they’re likely to buy him out.

10:25 p.m. Wednesday: Hart to Knicks
NBA GMs don’t sleep. Another trade was completed in the wee hours before deadline day as the Knicks acquired Josh Hart from the Trail Blazers, according to ESPN.

The Knicks send a big haul over to Portland for the 27-year-old, including Cam Reddish, Ryan Arcidiacono, former Raptor Svi Mykhailiuk and a protected first-round pick.

9:20 p.m. Wednesday: Change is coming but when?
While the Raptors have been one of the most talked-about teams in the NBA rumour mill, there’s still no guarantee a deal gets done on Thursday. As Bruce Arthur writes, change is coming but, if the right deal doesn’t present itself, it won’t come this week.

Read the full column here: Thursday is one deadline for the Raptors. It’s not the only one

8:12 p.m. Wednesday: Westbrook block-buster
Well, it happened. That Russell Westbrook trade we were hoping would hold off until Thursday did not, in fact, hold off until Thursday.

ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski reported that a three-team deal between the Lakers, Jazz and Timberwolves has been completed. Here’s how it breaks down:

Lakers receive: D’Angelo Russell, Malik Beasley and Jarred Vanderbilt

Timberwolves receive: Mike Conley, Nickeil Alexander-Walker and two second-round picks

Jazz receive: Russell Westbrook, Juan Toscano-Anderson, Damian Jones and a lightly protected 2027 LA first-round pick

It was also reported that Westbrook is expected to be bought out by the Jazz.

7:51 p.m. Wednesday: Raptors breakdown
The big question in Toronto heading into Thursday is simple: Will the Raptors trade any of their core players?

The Star’s Doug Smith listed off the team’s top trade candidates (Gary Trent Jr., Fred VanVleet, O.G. Anunoby and Pascal Siakam) and broke down why each player may or may not be traded.

Read the piece here: Will the Raptors deal any of their core players? A look at why and why not

7:16 p.m. Wednesday: Raptors working on Poeltl deal
Could a Raptors-Jakob Poeltl reunion be in the works?

According to Marc Stein, the Raptors and Spurs are discussing trade scenarios that would land Poeltl back with Toronto. The 27-year-old centre was drafted ninth overall by the Raptors in 2016 before being part of the package that was traded to San Antonio to acquire Kawhi Leonard in 2018.

5:16 p.m. Wednesday: Ujiri holds the cards
While news of Kyrie Irving demanding a trade shook up the entire trade market, it was quickly restored after his move to the Mavericks. Masai Ujiri can thank the Nets for their swift action.

Read Dave Feschuk’s column on why Masai Ujiri holds most of the cards at the trade deadline.

3:45 p.m. Wednesday: Please hold off
We beg you, NBA GMs, save the good stuff for Thursday. A busy week for the Lakers (the Kyrie Irving rumours and LeBron James becoming the league’s all-time leading scorer count as busy, right?) got even busier on Wednesday with reports that Russell Westbrook could be on the move.

Shams Charania of The Athletic tweeted this: The Lakers, Jazz and Timberwolves are in discussions on a three-team deal that would send D’Angelo Russell to the Lakers, Russell Westbrook and draft compensation such as a first-round pick to Utah and Mike Conley Jr. to Minnesota.

It’s shaping up to be an exciting deadline day.
