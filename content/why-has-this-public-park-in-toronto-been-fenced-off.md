There should be a public space revolution during Toronto’s municipal election, with candidates across the political spectrum jumping on the bandwagon, advocating and innovating with new ideas and enthusiasm for expanding and improving our public spaces.

There should be, but there isn’t.

The parks are shabby, maintenance is poor and essential human services like washrooms and fountains can’t seem to simply open and work reliably in this town, despite the mayor and councillors pledging that will change this year, just as they pledged last year. Lots of pledging, but left with the same budgets, and the same people in charge, we get the same old shabby public space.

Public spaces, most importantly our parks, have become as critical to city life as electricity and water. The pandemic made that starkly clear. If you don’t think so or haven’t experienced it yourself it’s probably because you have a backyard of your own to chill in, to have a family picnic, a nap or a beer without police or bylaw officer harassment. Most of our leaders have such yards.

Yet an ever-increasing number of Torontonians live in apartments without their own yard, so there’s a gap in leadership and representation. It’s not a priority for them and the proof can be seen all over the city.

George Hislop Park is an example of this. Despite being located in the middle of one of the densest places in North America, surrounded by many thousands of people living in small apartments, the linear park running between Charles and Isabella Streets, just east of Yonge, has been surrounded by a tall chain link fence for most of the pandemic. It’s been there so long that leaves and debris have collected under the fences and begun to compost.

Visiting last week, the park appears perfectly fine viewed through that fence, no worse for wear than any of our open and normally worse-for-wear parks. The small coffee and barber shop alongside the park off Charles Street is entered via a fenced corridor that is more prisonlike than park. Signs on the fence read “No Entry. Restricted Area. Authorized Use Only” as if it’s Area 51.

What a way to treat a precious public space in our city. Our park, locked and gated, with no urgency to open it. There is a plan to upgrade it and the other two linear parks to the south, a few years in the making, yet other parks have received similar upgrades and have not been fenced off like this.

A city spokesperson says the park “was closed in July 2020 to allow for deep cleaning of the park, soil remediation and to investigate the most suitable turf repair methodology,” as well as the discovery of a broken water line that was repaired in November of that year. Delays in redesign are blamed on the pandemic and complications due to the subway directly underneath. Improvements are now expected to begin in Spring 2023, but the park will remain fenced off.

Perhaps more honest are the other signs on the George Hislop fence that list the park hours (5:30 a.m. to midnight) and warn against erecting a tent, structure or camping in the park.

Ah, that’s the rub: there’s a shelter next door to this park and at times there were people living in the park. I saw them when I lived a block away for nearly a decade. We coexisted, imperfectly, but coexisted we did.

Does the lack of urgency with this park renovation and the presence of those fences have something to do with that? Since city officials fenced off Trinity Bellwoods and Alexandra Parks under the guise of rehabilitating them after the violent encampment evictions, fenced-in parks have become common in John Tory’s Toronto.

His mayoral challengers, Gil Penalosa in particular (a former parks commissioner in Bogota), have detailed plans for expanding and taking care of our public spaces, amenities and services. Tory or any other candidate would do well to steal Penalosa’s ideas, but only if they’d follow through on them.

They’d do well and be politically wise, too, because public sentiment is coming around. Recently Park People, a nationwide park advocacy charity, released its 2022 Canadian City Parks Report that included a survey of 3,000 Canadians across the country.

It found that 55 per cent of city residents said they spent more time in parks in the last year than the previous one, and 58 per cent said they would like to spend more time doing “new” activities they discovered, including walks along trails, eating outdoors and wandering naturalized areas (in Toronto, think the ravines or the Leslie Street Spit).

The increase in park use across Canada “may just be the beginning” says Park People, with survey respondents pointing to mental and physical health benefits of being outdoors. Park life is both a communal and personal experience, and the personal is especially political, so politicians beware.

There’s a widespread desire for more and better parks, and the Park People report states, as it has for the last three years, that park budgets are a nationwide problem, with insufficient operating funds and aging infrastructure. All that shabbiness — it doesn’t have to be this way.

If a candidate comes knocking, ask them what they’ve done or will do for public space. Ask for specifics so you can hold them to it. The public space revolution in Toronto won’t come unless you demand it: our leaders’ backyards are comfortable and shelter them from Toronto’s decline.
