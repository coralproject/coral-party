Cover up those plant babies, Toronto.

The city is under a frost warning as temperatures overnight into Thursday are expected to fall near or below the freezing mark, warns Environment Canada.

The warning was issued at 10 a.m. on Wednesday ahead of the drop in temperatures expected this evening.

The weather agency warns some areas near the lakes, however, may remain above freezing.

Environment Canada is calling for a 40 per cent chance of showers early this evening, and a low of zero degrees Celsius with “patchy frost” before skies clear Thursday morning.

“Cover up plants, especially those in frost-prone areas,” warned Environment Canada.

Frost advisories are issued when temperatures are forecast to reach the freezing mark threatening plants and crops during growing season.

Despite the frost warning, Thursday is shaping up to be sunny with a high of 13 C and a UV index of 6 or high, and a low of 7 C at night.
