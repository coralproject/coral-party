I have lived in Ontario for over 50 years and coming from a country where bicycles are a very large means of transportation, it struck me how poor bicycle traffic laws are enforced (going on sidewalks the wrong way; not stopping at traffic lights: no lights or markings at night; using crosswalks the wrong way; no bell and no signalling as to where they are going, and I can go on).

Yet a fair number of people wear a bicycle helmet; I think they see that as a lucky charm.

If one falls, (gravel!) most wounding is done on wrists, arm elbows (believe you me, I have been there).

And one definitely is not going to win when tangling with a car. On YouTube, there are quite a few movies of bicycle riding in Denmark and the Netherlands, and it is remarkable that there is a culture there of bicycle riding.

This brings me to the lack of that in Canada. But it seems the approach is a bit of "Flavour of the Month/Year approach" by the city planners. Yes, in the last few years, more has been done to accommodate bicycle riders. But it is only piecemeal. There is no consistent approach.

And after the winter it seems we all are starting over again.

I got "bicycle training" in grade school, mind you we also got swimming lessons in school (lots of water).

Yes I admit, it took 60 years or more in Europe. If we do not continue now with bicycle "thinking", we will never get there. And wearing only a helmet is not going to help.
