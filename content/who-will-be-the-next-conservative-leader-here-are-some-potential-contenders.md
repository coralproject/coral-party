OTTAWA — Another race to pick a new Conservative party leader is on.

And in the colourful words of one Conservative MP after Wednesday’s coup that toppled Erin O’Toole, “It’s gonna be a bloody tough job.”

A short race favours the already known and the already well-organized. A longer contest will give others a shot at it.

This will be the fourth leadership contest since the party was born of the 2003 merger between the Reform/Canadian Alliance and the Progressive Conservatives.

Here’s your cheat sheet on those around whom speculation is swirling:

Pierre Poilievre: The early front-runner. Finance critic, 42. Career politician, former cabinet minister and political aide. Upstaged both O’Toole and Andrew Scheer with savage attacks on Liberal spending policies. Fiscal hawk. Social media savvy. Strong organizer. Poilievre embraced the so-called “Freedom Convoy” plaguing downtown Ottawa now, calling its participants “Bright, joyful & peaceful Canadians championing freedom over fear on Parliament Hill.” If he doesn’t drop out of the race like he did last time, the job could be his to lose.

Conservative MP Pierre Poilievre speaks during a news conference Monday Nov. 16, 2020 in Ottawa.

Peter MacKay: The longtime aspirant. Lawyer, 56. Former leader of the Progressive Conservative party, who merged it with the Canadian Alliance and stepped aside as Harper ran to take over. Cabinet minister under Harper. Left politics in 2015 ahead of that year’s election. Tried to make a comeback in 2020. Ran to replace Scheer. Despite more caucus support including among many socially conservative MPs, he lost to O’Toole and is still paying off that debt. Now living in Nova Scotia, MacKay works with Deloitte and law firm McInnes Cooper. He is undoubtedly interested again, but much depends on what rules the party sets out.

Peter MacKay makes his opening statement at the start of the French Leadership Debate in Toronto on June 17, 2020.

Rona Ambrose: Gone but not forgotten. Former interim leader, 52, A Harper cabinet minister, she stepped up when he stepped down after losing in 2015. Socially progressive. Fiscally conservative. Ambrose unified a bruised caucus and was an effective critic of the rookie Trudeau government. Her bio touts that she was the “first leader of the Conservative party to back equal marriage and march in a gay pride parade.” Ambrose now sits on several corporate boards and think tanks, and opted out of the last leadership race. She would start as the strongest female candidate and could rally a lot of support, but may not take the leap.

Leslyn Lewis: Social conservative standard bearer. Rookie MP, 51. A Jamaican-born lawyer, Lewis blew onto the political scene when she ran against O’Toole for the leadership in 2020 and rallied the social conservative wing of the party. An opponent of abortion and COVID-19 vaccination mandates, she bitterly clashed with O’Toole’s team in the Conservative caucus. Tweeted, “The media and the power structure expect me to sit in the back of the bus. I won’t!” Her fans may want her to run again, but sources say Lewis has privately told others that she will not.

Leslyn Lewis arrives for the start of the English Leadership Debate in Toronto on Thursday, June 18, 2020.

Michelle Rempel Garner: Western warrior. Prominent Calgary MP, 41. Feminist with an economics degree, sommelier skills and a pro-business, pro-gun bent. Socially progressive, fiscally conservative. Strong advocate for LGBTQ rights. Takes no guff on social media. As an opposition critic, she is a cabinet minister’s worst nightmare. Married to a retired U.S. army veteran, she will be urged to run in the race and has flirted with the possibility in the past. One to watch.

Brad Wall: Former premier and Saskatchewan Party leader. Bright, quotable, 56. A consultant and political pundit, he left provincial politics in 2017 after a decade in power. His name is often floated for the national job but Wall doesn’t speak French and has not thrown his hat into the ring the last two times the leadership came open, perhaps mindful you need to parlez vous in Parliament.

Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall announces he is retiring from politics during a press conference at the Legislative Building in Regina on August 10, 2017.

Patrick Brown: Political animal. Brampton mayor, 43. A former Conservative MP who became leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario, then got bounced by his PC caucus amid allegations of misconduct. Definitely kicking the tires at a federal run, sources said Wednesday.

Caroline Mulroney: Ontario cabinet minister. Lawyer, bilingual, 47. Politically ambitious. The eldest child of former prime minister Brian Mulroney, and the only one to make the leap into elected politics, she ran for the Ontario PC leadership before she’d even run as an MPP. After a rocky start, is finding her feet as a provincial cabinet minister. May be too soon for a successful detour into federal politics.

Caroline Mulroney speaks to reporters following an early morning PC Caucus meeting at the Ontario Legislature in Toronto on Nov. 29, 2018.

Doug Ford: Ontario premier. Chief Etobicoke cheerleader, 57. Timing is everything, and it’s not on Ford’s side, this time. Several close to the premier believe he harbours a desire to be prime minister but faces a looming provincial election. Told reporters this week he has “my hands full. I love being premier of this province, we’re going to build this province, and I’m going to continue leading this province.” So that’s a hard maybe.

Andrew Scheer: Saskatchewan MP. Former Conservative leader and former Commons speaker, 42. Some of his caucus colleagues rue the day he was forced to step down after losing the 2019 election and would love to see him back. But Scheer has ruled out a comeback and wants to remain, as one supporter said, as a team player and one day serve as a cabinet minister in a Conservative government.
