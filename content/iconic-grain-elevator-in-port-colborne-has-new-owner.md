An iconic fixture on the Welland Canal in Port Colborne’s north end, the former Robin Hood Multifoods flour mill has a new owner who has plans to keep the existing workforce and expand the facility.

On Wednesday London Agricultural Commodities (LAC) announced the purchase of Ceres Global Ag’s Port Colborne terminal (formerly Robin Hood) for $4 million (U.S.).

“It’s exciting with new ownership for sure,” said Kevin Reles of the facility at the end of Sherwood Forest Lane.

Reles, manager since 2017, said LAC, started in 1985, is committed to capital expenditures and looking to the future to make the facility more of a presence on the canal for grain storage and shipping.

Grains such as corn, wheat and soybeans are stored in the 129 bins in the elevator, the southern portion of the facility, with a capacity of 2.2 million bushels, or 62,500 tonnes.


Alongside a berth on the east side of the facility in the canal and weir for domestic and ocean-going vessels, the site has truck and rail access and a grain drying system installed in 2020.

In 2019, Minneapolis, Minn.-based Ceres and LAC signed a lease agreement that saw the London, Ont.-based company store grains from farmers across southern Ontario and Niagara Region.

Ceres owned the terminal, which had produced flour when owned by Robin Hood, since 2009 under different names.

“The sale of the Port Colborne facility further enhances our strategic partnership with LAC and aligns with our long-term strategy of optimizing our footprint around our core products and the locations where we operate,” said Ceres chief executive officer Carlos Paz.

Reles said there was a purchase agreement in the lease between the two companies, which LAC exercised.

He and LAC said the seven current employees will be rehired, maintaining employment levels and retaining the workforce’s knowledge base.

A release from LAC said the company expects the facility will, in time, see increased cargo volumes to export markets served by southern Ontario farming exports of soybeans, wheat and corn.

It said domestic carriers will handle cargo tonnage bound for St. Lawrence River transfer to ocean-going Panamax-sized vessels, along with regular seaway ‘saltie’ fleets to reach global markets with Niagara-grown crops.

Reles said shipping traffic has increased at the grain terminal over the past few years.

Last year, nine vessels stopped to take on various grain cargo. That was a record for the company.

“I wanted to hit 10,” said Reles.

LAC president Richard Smibert said supporting the farming sector in Ontario has always been a priority for the agricultural company.

“This strategic move to take ownership of a facility we have previously leased further demonstrates our commitment to the industry and exercises our ability to efficiently plan for more internationally bound cargo shipments,” said Smibert in the release.

The company said as grain volumes grow, it will build additional grain storage to support the business.

The announcement comes just more than a month after the federal government and St. Lawrence Seaway Management Corp. announced a $45.3-million project to reconstruct wharfs 18-1, 18-2 and 18-3 at the south end of the canal.

Ottawa is contributing $22.7 million, and the seaway $22.6 million on the west side of the canal running from the end of West Street south to ADM milling. The wharves have sat vacant for more than a decade due to crumbling walls.

The seaway welcomed the move by LAC to purchase the Ceres storage facility and additional marine movements it will bring to the canal.

“We expect to work with the team at LAC and highlight their commitment to continuing to buoy the Ontario farming community and use our available capacity,” said Bruce Hodgson, the seaway’s director of business development.

Under the change, Reles said the facility will now own the grain it moves in and out of the storage bins.

“Back when we first started in 2009, we were more connected with futures trading. We’d fill the building with grain and sit on it.”

Reles said with LAC owning the building, it’s easier for the company to justify any future investment, capital expenditures, and modernization of the facility built in the 1940s.
