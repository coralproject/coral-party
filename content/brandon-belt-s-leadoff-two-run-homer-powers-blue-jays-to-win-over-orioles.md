Here’s what you need to know about the Blue Jays’ 6-3 win in 10 innings over the Orioles at Camden Yards in Baltimore on Tuesday:

Swing and a ...
You don’t see a leadoff two-run homer very often, but that’s what Brandon Belt supplied on the first pitch of the top of the 10th to send the Jays on their way to victory.

The 35-year-old jumped all over Mike Baumann’s centre-cut fastball and blasted it deep into the Maryland night for his sixth home run of the month and third in the last two games.

Belt, who started the season a miserable 1-for-23 with 15 strikeouts, is second on the team in on-base-plus-slugging percentage, behind only Bo Bichette, and is hitting .321 with an 1.155 OPS in August.

Run-saving plays
The Blue Jays are the best defensive team in the majors this season, and the contributions of the defenders don’t often show up in the boxscore.

That was true again in the fifth inning Tuesday when rookie Jordan Westburg greeted reliever Yimi Garcia with a game-tying double down the left field line.

With two out, one would have expected a runner with above-average speed to score from first, especially given the depth of the left-field corner in Baltimore. But Daulton Varsho got a great break on the ball and made it to the corner in a hurry. His quick throw to the infield kept Austin Hays, who would have been the go-ahead run, at third.

The gloves also showed up huge in the bottom of the ninth when both Bo Bichette and Whit Merrifield made sensational plays on ground balls with runners on base to preserve the tie and get the game to extra innings.

Starting the runner
The Blue Jays haven’t been as aggressive on the bases as many believed they would be this season, but sending a runner at the right time led to a big run in the top of the fourth.

With one out, Matt Chapman took off from first on a full-count pitch to Danny Jansen, who hit a ground ball to shortstop that would have been an inning-ending double play had the runner stayed put.

Instead, the only play was at first base, keeping the inning alive for Kevin Kiermaier, who doubled Chapman home.
