On the second night of a back-to-back, some fresh legs would be a welcome addition for the Raptors against the Heat. As it happens, they will receive exactly that as Kyle Lowry was deemed available by Nick Nurse not long ago.

Lowry returns after being out since midway through the front end of their back-to-back in Milwaukee last Tuesday, less than 24 hours after Toronto’s 16-game winning streak in games without Lowry was snapped by Philly. That game showcased exactly why the Raptors are in fact better when their six-time All-Star point guard is available, as if that were ever a real question. Simply lifting the burden off of Pascal Siakam and Fred VanVleet to do everything will be of immense help. Of course we know Lowry’s capable of much more than just temporarily driving bus, too.

Toronto will look to get back above .500 after a brief flirtation with that status between Sunday and Tuesday. And with the schedule release revealing a creamy Raptors schedule in March, there’s a legit shot to get a serious run of wins started tonight as the team returns to full health (/knocks vigorously on my hardwood floor).
