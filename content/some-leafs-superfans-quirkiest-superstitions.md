When Ken Judge watches the Maple Leafs from home, he sits in front of his television with his two toy dogs by his side. Each time the Leafs score, Judge rings a bell and his pekinese, Pixie, and 15-year-old chihuahua, Chico, join in the celebration, howling and barking along.

“My whole neighbourhood can hear it,” he told the Star on Wednesday.

For Leafs superfans like Judge, superstitions are part of the fun. In a sport where the outcome is often unpredictable (look no further than the Leafs’ come-from-behind win against the Tampa Bay Lightning in Game 4), these rituals offer fans a sense of control.

Some last the duration of a playoff series, before fans ditch them for another ritual that they hope will be successful, while others stretch on for years.

Ahead of the Leafs’ pivotal Game 5 on Thursday, in which they could clinch the series and move on to the second playoff round for the first time in nearly two decades, the Star spoke with diehard fans who shared how they’re preparing for the big game.

The dog-bell ritual is just one of several for Judge, 55, who’s been a Leafs fan since he was a young kid, when his grandfather introduced him to the sport.

“The Leafs have been pretty much my everyday thinking in my life,” said Judge, a sports podcaster from Stouffville who has a Leafs tattoos on each calf. “I don’t know anyone who is more diehard than I am.”

Other than the dog bell, Judge switches up his superstitions each season. This year, he’s also growing a playoff beard. Though he despises the feeling when his moustache gets into his mouth, he plans to grow it until the Leafs’ playoff run ends. (He insists this is the year they will win the Stanley Cup, and is ready to go the distance with his facial hair.)

Chantal Barrett-Papworth, who grew up near the Danforth, said her family and five or six of her neighbours would gather on their front lawns with their TVs to watch the Leafs when she was a kid.

Now 32, she carries on the tradition by dressing all the members of her household in Leafs paraphernalia — including her dog, Pandora, and cat, Chickpea.

“If you’re going to watch a Leafs game, you have to wear at least something blue,” she told the Star.

Vicky Forster’s superstition is only days old. She put on a pair of Leafs socks for Game 2, after the team’s painful loss to start the series. Since the Leafs won that second game in stunning fashion, she’s worn them for every game since. So far, those socks have a perfect 3-0 record.

“I’m hoping they’ll have a long run,” said Forster, who works in management at a Toronto hospital. “They’re getting a little gross already, but I’ll keep doing it for the sake of the team.”

James Hynes, 60, has been a superstitious Leafs fans his whole life. When the Star checked in with him in 2021, he had a host of rituals, including always standing during the national anthem, even at home, and not wearing an Auston Matthews jersey because it brought bad luck.

But Hynes had an epiphany last year, following the Leafs’ brutal Game 7 loss to the Lightning.

“It hit rock bottom for me,” he recalled. “Then I kind of realized, no matter what I do with the Leafs, no matter all my superstitions … they don’t really affect how they play and if they win or not.”

Though the rituals evolve from year to year, what never changes is Hynes’s support for the Leafs.

What does the team mean to him — and perhaps to every other superfan?

“It’s everything,” he said.
